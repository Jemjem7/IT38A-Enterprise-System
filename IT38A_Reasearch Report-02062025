Title: Comparative Analysis of Successful and Failed Enterprise System Implementations


Case Study 1: Successful Enterprise System Implementation



Company Overview: John Deere

* The implementation Reason:

John Deere is a globally recognized maker of agricultural, construction, and forestry equipment. 
As the company grew, its legacy systems became more and more fragmented, thus impairing supply chain coordination and data integration. 
To enhance efficiencies and decision-making, John Deere has implemented SAP ERP to standardize its business processes across the global network.

Implementation Process

*Implementation Process
*Strategic Planning: An elaborate need-assessment with the full participation of key stakeholders was conducted early in the process.
*Vendor Selection: SAP ERP was chosen for its flexibility, scalability, and solutions for specific industries.
*Phased Deployment: The system was fully implemented through a phased approach commencing with pilot programs.
*Employee Training and Change Management: Comprehensive training was provided to all users, with a support system to assist in the transition to the new system.
*Post-Implementation Monitoring: This team has been responsible for monitoring system performance and making ongoing improvements.


Key Success Factors

- Strong leadership and stakeholder engagement: The project had full support from top executive sponsors and key business units. 

- Phased Approach & Pilot Testing: Refines the system before global deployment. 

- Comprehensive Training Programs: Had the purpose of ensuring its employees were correctly utilizing the system. 

- Evidence-Based Decision Making: Improved efficiency through improved acquisition of real-time operational insight.


Outcomes & Impact

*Increased Productivity: Improved business process across different locations or countries.

*Improved Resource Management: Having data available in real time made it possible to allocate best resources .

*Improved Logistics: Reduced logistics lags and delays.

*ERP systems are cost effective in the long run and greatly improve resource management.



Case Study 2: Failed Enterprise System Implementation



Company Overview: Target Canada

*Reason For Implementations:
The American retail chain Target aimed to enter the Canadian market. The business had planned to deploy a new ERP system for inventory and supply chain management as part of its operations.
Operational failures became severe because Target Canada inadequately prepared the system, tested it improperly, and struggled with database transfer errors.

Implementation Process & Challenges

- The company decided to open 124 stores within two years despite inadequate time to effectively implement the ERP system.
- The incorrect product information along with pricing errors in the system led to inventory management problems.
- The lack of complete testing for the ERP system caused large disruptions in the supply chain through its unrestrained launch.
- Employee training issues led to system unacquaintance which caused both delay and errors that affected daily operations.
- The system failed to consider Canadian retail logistics specifications thus causing stock deficits in addition to unnecessary excess inventory.
